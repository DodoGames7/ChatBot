# General development FAQ

# will Kirbo Support v6?
this is actually planned but not for now because v6 isn't really finished (even tho it's released but buggy because half of the stuff are left unupdated)

# why is Kirbo Chatbot reply system down?
Kirbo has nothing to do with the system it's using, the downtime can only happen when **pop cat** api itself is down, there however in the future i may release a system that you can change the current api used in case if the other one is having a such downtime

# why is the first version starts with smth like 3.0.0, should you have start with 1.0.0?
the older versions were actually exist but closed source, v3 was the first release to be open source

# can i make a suggestion?
just open Github issues to suggest or use [discussions](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Kirbo/discussions) tab

# is there a support server for Kirbo?
yeah there is, you can join with This [Link](https://discord.gg/pFwKjAaZvj)
