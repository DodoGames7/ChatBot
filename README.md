# ChatBot
an simple aoi.js v5 chatbot using pop cat api for talking with people

# story
this was belonging to an private discord bot project named Con Man (since early versions of v1 and v2), even tho v1 was existing but on a completely different project, also starting with v3 i had enough of discord.js nonsense with rewrite which comes in every single major update, so i decided to rewrite con man to be different starting with v3 here but also open sourced, i'm currently running out of ideas so if you want to fix an bug or add an improvement then really feel free to open an pull request there i will try to check them as fast as possible

Fact: originally this project was named as **Mr.ChatBot** until i changed my mind by using Kirby's Face as a pfp (only on my chatbot) and the name that refers to the character aka **Kirbo**

# warning
you need message content enabled so the bot can then talk without issue

# Features
* microsoft translator built-in
* set and or remove current chatbot channel anytime depending on your decision
* tries to be lightweight by not using all stuff that increases resources
* uses pop cat api by default so no random downtimes (unless if the api itself went down)
* customize on how you want Kirbo to behave using settings command!
